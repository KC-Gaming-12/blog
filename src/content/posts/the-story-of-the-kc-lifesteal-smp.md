# The story behind the KC Lifesteal SMP

### How it all began
The KC Lifesteal SMP started when I learned about Minecraft servers, One day I decided to get my friends together to start a minecraft server. The server was origionally on [Aternos](https://aternos.org) but I had a spare computer laying around so I made use of it.

### Our Plan
The plan was to go public and bring a lifesteal server for everyone to enjoy! I was looking on [name.com](https://name.com) for a domain and I found [lifesteal.team](https://www.lifesteal.team). I bought the domain and made play.lifesteal.team, So I got a server set up and ported forward to my domain.
