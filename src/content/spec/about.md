## About The KC Lifesteal SMP
KC Lifesteal SMP is a Minecraft Java server that uses geyser and operates under the unique rule of lifesteal, where players can gain hearts by killing other players and lose hearts when killed themselves. If a player's hearts drop to zero, they are banned from the server until another player revives them. The server is currently offline as of the last ping on August 12, 2024. It is located in the United States and is running on Minecraft version 1.20.1.
